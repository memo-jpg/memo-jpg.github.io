		I've only had for a day so can't comment on longevity. I see other 1 star reviews on things like not being able to connect it. Well those users aren't the brightest because they are trying to connect it wirelessly as a wired controller. Need to go to settings to enable usb controllers. I had no issues with mine connecting. The rgb is basic yet sleek imo. I previously purchased one with the lightning rgb and honestly it's just tacky. It's comfortable and seems rigid enough. However yes just like all of these the plastic is ok. Durable enough. But I do wish nintendo made a first party premium version. Or someone like razer. Looks wise I think this is one of the better ones although u will see numerous ones on here from different vendors that are identical down to the packaging.

		Make sure you turn on pro controllers.<br>
		I did this while waiting for the controller to arrive as my son's original controllers broke. This is the perfect addition to his oled, he loves the fact that he can change the lights and that it is sturdy. It charges the device with no issues and they even included an additional charging cable.
